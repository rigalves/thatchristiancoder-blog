Thanks for stopping by! I’m a Costa Rican Christian software developer building wtrfll, an open-source lyrics and scripture projection tool for small churches. Here I’ll share practical notes on .NET, Vue, and Astro, along with thoughts on church tech, worship drumming, apologetics, and parenting. New posts are coming soon—stay tuned.

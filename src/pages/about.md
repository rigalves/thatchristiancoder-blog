# About

I'm a Costa Rican Christian software developer sharing stories about code, church tech, faith, worship, and life.

I'm building [wtrfll](https://github.com/rigalves/wtrfll), an open-source lyrics and scripture projection tool for small churches, while working with stacks like .NET, Vue, and Astro.

Around here you'll see posts on developer workflows, church production and worship tech, apologetics, worship drumming, and the messy, joyful parts of parenting.

# wtrfll project

wtrfll is an open-source lyrics and scripture projection tool I’m building for small churches. It’s focused on being simple, reliable, and easy to run on modest hardware—no production desk required.

I’m designing it for quick song swaps, scripture slides, and minimal setup so volunteers can operate it confidently. More details, screenshots, and a download link are coming soon. In the meantime, you can follow progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/rigalves/wtrfll).

    <h1 class="heading">About</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I'm a Costa Rican Christian software developer sharing stories about
      code, church tech, faith, worship, and life.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I'm building wtrfll, an open-source lyrics and scripture projection tool
      for small churches, while working with stacks like .NET, Vue, and Astro.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Around here you'll see posts on developer workflows, church production and
      worship tech, apologetics, worship drumming, and the messy, joyful parts
      of parenting.

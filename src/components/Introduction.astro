  <p>
    Welcome to That Christian Coder: stories about code, church tech, faith,
    worship, and life from a Costa Rican Christian software developer.

  <p>
    I build wtrfll, an open-source lyrics and scripture projection tool for
    small churches, and write about .NET, Vue, Astro, worship drumming,
    apologetics, and parenting.

<h1 class="heading">Welcome to my journey of faith, code, and life</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    I'm Rigoberto, a software developer and follower of Christ from rainy,
    coffee-scented Costa Rica. I'm learning to navigate this unusual whirlwind of
    writing code, serving the Church, and leading a family with Christ at the
    center. If good code, healthy churches, sincere faith, and real family life
    matter to you, you'll feel at home here.

    I also build <a
      href="https://github.com/rigalves/wtrfll"
      target="blank"
      class="link animation">wtrfll</a
    >, an open-source, LAN-friendly app to display lyrics and scripture for small
    churches that can't afford big-name software. It's simple for volunteers,
    runs on everyday hardware, and is my way of helping churches serve their
    congregations with the tools they already have.
